In the present review, diverse structural types of c-Met kinase inhibitors have been reported, and an overview of various interactions with amino acid residues of cMet kinase active site have also been included as indicated by the molecular modeling studies and/or X-ray crystallographic studies. Several class I c-Met kinase inhibitors possessing C-6 substituted bicyclic aromatic scaffolds like triazolotriazine, triazolo[4,5-b]pyrazine, triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine, triazolopyridinone, [1,2,4]triazolo [4,3-a]pyridine, 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine, indazole, purine, pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, imidazo[4,5-b]pyrazine, etc. have been synthesized. This bicyclic aromatic scaffold generally has an aromatic hinge binding element with a linker like methylene, oxymethylene, aminomethylene, difluoromethylene, sulfonyl, sulfur, sulfoxide or cyclopropyl. Binding mode analysis of class I c-Met kinase inhibitors reveals the importance of nitrogen containing bicyclic aromatic ring with substitution at C-6 in making p-p stacking interactions with Tyr1230 and a hydrogen bond with Asp1222. The linker is considered to be important between the two aromatic scaffolds to wrap around Met1211. The aromatic hinge binder interacts via hydrogen bonding with Met1160 and/or Pro1158. These class I inhibitors have good degree of selectivity towards c-Met kinase but weak inhibitor of c-Met Tyr1230 Fig. 49. Secoiridoid as a c-Met kinase inhibitor. 1132 P.K. Parikh, M.D. Ghate / European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 143 (2018) 1103e1138 mutants. Based on binding mode analysis, it can also be concluded that to maintain the desired “U” shaped skeleton of the class I inhibitors, selection of a bicyclic nitrogen containing scaffold, linker and aromatic residue is the key to the development of potent and selective class I c-Met kinase inhibitors."""
